# Trigger Failure Strategy

This repo has a simple example of a way to handle triggers that get in a loop constantly retrying a failed command.

When the trigger reaches its maximum amount of failures, a `TriggerFailureNotification` contract is created
that includes the failure messages that accumulated during the triggers last run. The party running the
trigger then has the opportunity to exercise the `StartTrigger` choice which will reset the amount of failures
and let the trigger restart.

To test this out, build both the trigger dar and model dar (`make build` will place them in `target`) and upload
them to Daml Hub (or the example can be [run locally](https://docs.daml.com/triggers/index.html#run-a-no-op-trigger)).


Start a trigger as Alice, and then create an `AssetOrArchive` contract with `fail` set to true. When the
trigger fails 10 times, it will pause and create the notification contract, on which the `StartTrigger`
choice can be exercised and the trigger will start again.

To use this code in your own project:

1. Include `TriggerFailureNotification` and `FailedTriggerStartRequest` from [daml/Main.daml](daml/Main.daml) in your model
2. Include `FailureState`, `updateStateFailures` and `withFailures` from [triggers/daml/Trigger.daml](triggers/daml/Trigger.daml) in your trigger's Daml code
3. Use `updateStateFailure` as the `updateState` function in your `Trigger` settings function. If you have a custom `updateState` function, you will need to call `updateStateFailures` in it.
4. In your `initialize` function, use `initFailureState` with the number of possible retries
4. Use `FailureState` as the trigger's state (e.g. `T.Trigger FailureState`)
4. Wrap all code in your trigger rule in `withFailures` as seen below.

Example:

```haskell
trigger : T.Trigger FailureState
trigger = T.Trigger
  { initialize = pure $ initFailureState 10
  , updateState = updateStateFailures
  , rule = triggerRule
  , registeredTemplates = T.AllInDar
  , heartbeat = None
  }

triggerRule : Party -> T.TriggerA FailureState ()
triggerRule party = withFailures party $ do
      -- trigger code here as normal
      return ()
```

If you are already using a custom state in your trigger, you will have to include `FailureState` in it and
modify `updateStateFailures`, `initTriggerState` and `withFailures` accordingly.
