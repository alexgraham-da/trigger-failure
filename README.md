# Trigger Failure Strategy

This repo has a simple example of a way to handle triggers that fail constantly retrying.

When the trigger reaches its maximum amount of failures, a `TriggerFailureNotification` contract is created
that includes the failure messages that accumulated during the triggers last run. The party running the
trigger then has the opportunity to exercise the `StartTrigger` choice which will reset the amount of failures
and let the trigger restart.

To test this out, build both the trigger dar and model dar and upload them to Daml Hub (or run locally).

Start a trigger as Alice, and then create an `AssetOrArchive` contract with `fail` set to true. When the
trigger fails 5 times, it will pause and create the notification contract, which can then be excercised
and the trigger will start again.
